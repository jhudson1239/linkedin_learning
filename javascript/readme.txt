This is just a simple fun little FAQ page. I got given this as a task to do in one of my interviews, it included styling and other aspects. In the end I did not have time to attempt the
JS side of the task but instead I have decided to mock up a quick little sandbox and attempt it at home.

What have I learned?
Well a problem was to hide the sections that didnt need to be seen once a category of questions was changed. I sovled this by setting all questions to hidden upon click of the button and
then showing the one that was needed. It was a fun little task, the code maybe a little crude but I believe ill become more advanced the further I move into the javascript tutorials.
